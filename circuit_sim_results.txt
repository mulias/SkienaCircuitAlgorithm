These are the averages for running the simulation 1000 times. For the advanced
traversal algorithm, we make an MST, then cluster so that points less than 10
distance from each other are in the same cluster.

Interestingly, the cluster size doesn't change our results by much. These are 
the averages for a cluster size of 0, meaning the two arms are loosly tracing 
the MST. The fact that results are comperable implies that my clustering method
could be better, or that the biggest improvment is in using the MST instead of
hitting all points from left to right.

Full descriptions of what the robot arms do in each algorithm, for 10, 20, and
40 circuit points. In the advanced algorithm the arms backtrack sometimes
because they have to check each point one for each cluster the point is in. If
a point is in multiple clusters we will check it multiple times.
